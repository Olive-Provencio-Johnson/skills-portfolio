# Skills-Portfolio

 
## Description
 
This is my first iteration of my portfolio using the html and css. I will make changes to this portfolio as my skills develop and improve. 
 
 
## Issues Addressed Here

* Provided my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
* The UI scrolls to the corresponding sections when the links in the navigation are clicked
* When the Work section is clicked, then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the my applications
* The first image of my applications is larger in size than the others
* The images take the user to the deployed applications. 
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devisce, then the UI is presented with a responsive layout that adapts to their viewport
